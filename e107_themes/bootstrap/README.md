# Bootstrap Theme

## Front-end

The bootstrap theme for e107 aims to be a direct port of the example files found here: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/getting-started.html#examples
Each main example is included as a different layout and minimal e107 css has been added.
New core templates have been added so that custom templates (eg. login, forum etc) need not be used.  

**Layouts**

* Starter template
* Basic marketing site
* Fluid layout
* Carousel jumbotron

## Back-end

The default admin theme in v2.x 
Much of the admin-area has been modified to take advantage of bootstrap features.
